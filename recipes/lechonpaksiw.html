        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Paksiw is a term associated to a dish that is cooked with vinegar and garlic. 
            <strong>Lechon Paksiw</strong> is a Filipino pork dish made from leftover roast pig which is known as “Lechon”. 
            Aside from using roast pig, leftover <em>Lechon kawali</em> can also be used. Making this dish is a practical way to recycle leftover pork. 
            Instead of reheating the same dish over and over, making paksiw out of it makes the pork more flavorful bringing more life to the ingredient.</p>
        
        <p>The secret to a good Lechon Paksiw lies on the Lechon sauce used. 
            Since the sauce is one of the main sources of the dish's flavor, having a good one will surely increase your success rate.
