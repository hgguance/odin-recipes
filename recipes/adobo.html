    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dish and cooking process native to the <em>Philippines</em>, <strong>adobo</strong> refers to the method of marinating meat, seafood, or vegetables (pretty much anything!) in a combination of soy sauce and vinegar. 
        This marinade also includes other herbs and flavorings like garlic, bay leaves, and whole peppercorns. </p>

    <p> Cooking food in vinegar is no foreign concept to us Filipinos. In pre-colonial times, our ancestors used to cook seafood in vinegar in order to preserve their freshness. 
        Many regard adobo as a spin on kinilaw, which is another traditional cooking method. Kinilaw refers mainly to cooking raw seafood in vinegar and spices. 
        Another similar process is paksiw, which utilizes meat broth in vinegar and spices.</p>
