        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's a well known fact that <em>Filipinos</em> love stew and soup dishes. From the sour sinigang to the sweet tinola, there's guaranteed to be a soup dish for every flavor palate preference -- all great to sip and enjoy, especially during long, cool nights. 
            But one of the most popular, and arguably most delicious, soups out there, is the classic <strong>Bulalo</strong>, or beef shank stew.</p>
        <p>One might classify bulalo as a kind of nilaga -- after all, there doesn't seem to be much difference in ingredients, nor in the cooking process. 
            But what sets bulalo apart is the very specific choice of meat we use for it. 
            The star of a great bulalo is always the meat -- more specifically, the use of beef shank, with marrow still inside the bone. 
            The meat of bulalo is famous for melting in your mouth, practically falling off the bone with how tender it becomes!</p>
